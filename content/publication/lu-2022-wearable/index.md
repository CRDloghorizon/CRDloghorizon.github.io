abstract: Pressure sensing in prosthetic sockets is valuable as it provides quantified data to assist prosthetists in designing comfortable sockets for amputees. We present a wearable pressure sensing system for lower limb amputees. The full system consists of three essential elements from sensing scheme (wearable sensors, sensor calibration and deployment), electronic measurement system (embedded hardware and software), to time-series database and visualization. The full system has been successfully applied in clinical trials to effectively collect pressure data in real-time.
