abstract: The irregular pressure exerted by a prosthetic socket over the residual limb is one of the major factors that cause the discomfort of amputees using artificial limbs. By deploying the wearable sensors inside the socket, the interfacial pressure distribution can be studied to find the active regions and rectify the socket design. In this case study, a clustering-based analysis method is presented to evaluate the density and layout of these sensors, which aims to reduce the local redundancy of the sensor deployment. In particular, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and K-means algorithm are employed to find the clustering results of the sensor data, taking the pressure measurement of a predefined sensor placement as the input. Then, one suitable clustering result is selected to detect the layout redundancy from the input area. After that, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as a similarity metric to guide the removal of redundant sensors and generate a new sparser layout. The Jensonâ€“Shannon Divergence (JSD) and the mean pressure are applied as posterior validation metrics that compare the pressure features before and after sensor removal. A case study of a clinical trial with two sensor strips is used to prove the utility of the clustering-based analysis method. The sensors on the posterior and medial regions are suggested to be reduced, and the main pressure features are kept. The proposed method can help sensor designers optimize sensor configurations for intra-socket measurements and thus assist the prosthetists in improving the socket fitting.
