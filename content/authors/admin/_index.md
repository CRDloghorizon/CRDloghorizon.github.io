## Biography

I am a final-year Doctoral student at the Division of Electronic and Embedded Systems, School of EECS, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, mainly advised by Professor [Zhonghai Lu](https://www.kth.se/profile/zhonghai), and co-supervised by Associate Professor [Dejiu Chen](https://www.kth.se/profile/chendj). 

My research interests include hardware accelerators for AI, Network-on-Chip, and embedded sensor systems. My recent research focuses on Network-on-Chip-based hardware accelerators, aiming to enhance their performance and efficiency for deep neural network tasks. 

I received a B.S. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 2018, and an M.S. degree in embedded systems from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2020.
